            Hello, I’m Graeme Elliott, and I’m an accomplished Product Owner and
            Subject Matter Expert in Brand Protection with more than ten years
            of success in helping companies define and design value-driven
            solutions that assist in achieving overall strategic business
            growth. I have strong analytical and communication skills coupled
            with the ability to multi-task, work independently and
            collaboratively with large teams, and thrive in a fast-paced,
            start-up environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have over eight years of experience developing and implementing
            successful global brand protection programs for clients to help
            protect their brand value online. I have honed my skills in
            analysing, researching and mitigating potential security risks,
            identifying counterfeit products, and uncovering details about bad
            actors behind fraudulent activities. I have also produced
            investigative reports into brand protection issues such as the sale
            of counterfeit goods, websites phishing for user details,
            unauthorised use of branding and sale of goods, and internet piracy.
            My research findings have previously been distributed in the media.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a proactive leader, I excel in collaborating with clients to
            understand their issues and provide analysis and commentary while
            guiding them through problem-solving strategies. I am skilled in
            building enduring relationships with customers and clients whilst
            maintaining existing services and seeking new growth opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Product Owner, I have led cross-functional teams and
            stakeholders throughout the product development lifecycle. I have a
            deep understanding of Agile processes and principles. I use my
            strong communication, presentation, and leadership skills to align
            teams and stakeholders towards a shared vision and roadmap. I also
            have experience coordinating the gathering of knowledge to solve
            problems and improve products by working with clients and key
            stakeholders to create features with user stories. I am highly
            organised and efficient in ensuring alignment and agreement,
            planning and prioritising product releases, and providing guidance
            and training to others to ensure efficient outcomes.

          <p>
            Throughout my product career, I have helped establish clear product
            visions to increase product engagement and usability, help define
            areas for creating efficiencies, and position products to increase
            sales, client growth and market share. This has involved creating
            and prioritising backlogs that align with business and product
            goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            With my technical understanding and expertise in product management,
            I am able to bridge the gap between business goals and technology
            solutions to ensure maximum value is achieved. I am passionate about
            delivering products that meet user needs, drive business success,
            and contribute to overall organisational growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another keen interest of mine is data gathering, analysis, and
            visualisation. I often use these skills to create dashboards and
            reports that provide insights into trends that help support my
            team’s and clients’ decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I am a web development hobbyist, learning web
            development technologies such as JavaScript, React and Next JS
            through online resources and textbooks. This has enabled me to gain
            an in-depth understanding of how websites are structured. I enjoy
            building user-friendly and responsive websites and learning more
            about best web design practices with every project I undertake.
            Whilst most of my projects are predominantly front-end, I have also
            been learning back-end technologies such as Node.js.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please get in touch with me via LinkedIn if you want to discuss my
            skills and experience further. I am actively seeking new
            opportunities to engage in the product space and would welcome any
            prospect to learn, grow and develop.
