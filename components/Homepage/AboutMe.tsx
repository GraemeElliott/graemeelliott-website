            Hello, I’m Graeme Elliott, and I’m an accomplished Product Owner and
            Subject Matter Expert in Brand Protection with more than ten years
            of success in helping companies define and design value-driven
            solutions that assist in achieving overall strategic business
            growth. I have strong analytical and communication skills coupled
            with the ability to multi-task, work independently and
            collaboratively with large teams, and thrive in a fast-paced,
            start-up environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Product Owner, I have led cross-functional teams and
            stakeholders throughout the product development lifecycle. I have a
            deep understanding of Agile processes and principles. I use my
            strong communication, presentation, and leadership skills to align
            teams and stakeholders towards a shared vision and roadmap. I also
            have experience coordinating the gathering of knowledge to solve
            problems and improve products by working with clients and key
            stakeholders to create features with user stories. I am highly
            organised and efficient in ensuring alignment and agreement,
            planning and prioritising product releases, and providing guidance
            and training to others to ensure efficient outcomes.

            With my technical understanding and expertise in product management,
            I am able to bridge the gap between business goals and technology
            solutions to ensure maximum value is achieved. I am passionate about
            delivering products that meet user needs, drive business success,
            and contribute to overall organisational growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I am a web development hobbyist, learning web
            development technologies such as JavaScript, React, Vue JS, Next JS
            and Node Js through online resources and textbooks. This has enabled
            me to gain an in-depth understanding of how websites are structured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please get in touch with me via LinkedIn if you want to discuss my
            skills and experience further. I am actively seeking new
            opportunities to engage in the product space and would welcome any
            prospect to learn, grow and develop.
