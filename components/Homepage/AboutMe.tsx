          My name is Graeme Elliott and I am an accomplished Product Manager and
          Subject Matter Expert in Brand Protection with more than ten years of
          success in helping companies define and design value-driven solutions
          that assist in achieving overall strategic business growth. I have
          strong analytical and communication skills coupled with the ability to
          multi-task, work independently, and thrive in a fast-paced, start-up
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years I have been developing and implementing successful
          global brand protection programs for clients to help protect their
          brands’ value. I have also shown my ability to develop deep and
          enduring relationships with clients, where I have maintained existing
          services as well as seek new opportunities for expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a proactive leader, my style of working is a collaborative type; I
          excel at providing a detailed analysis and commentary of various
          infringement issues so that together with clients we can choose and
          implement the most practical and efficient enforcement strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In making use of multiple technologies to identify, examine, and
          eliminate infringing content for brands, I help protect the brands’
          value by creating and implementing a successful brand protection
          strategy. I have also produced investigative reports into brand
          protection issues such as the sale of counterfeit goods, websites
          phishing for user details, unauthorised use of branding and sale of
          goods, and internet piracy. My research findings have also been
          distributed in the media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career I have gained skills and experience in data
          gathering, analysis and visualisation. This includes using
          technologies such as SQL for database queries as well as Power BI and
          Tableau for data cleaning and visualisation. This has enabled me to
          produce dashboards and reports that have been used to give further
          insights into trends, map out any problems needing to be sold, and
          make decision making easier for my team and my clients. Data analysis,
          as well as presenting my findings, is at the forefront of every task
          that I do.

          As a Product Manager, I have experience in responsibilities where I
          have coordinated the gathering of knowledge to problem solve and
          improve the product. This includes interaction with key stakeholders
          to understand their challenges and pain points, help create features
          with user stories, and manage the product roadmap. Throughout my
          career, I have always had an interest in product management and
          development, and have always sought opportunities to develop and
          execute innovative product strategies that support awareness,
          engagement and satisfaction, and facilitate the collaboration of
          multiple departments. This has led to the successful development and
          deployment of new functionalities and features that have benefited the
          teams, clients and the company.

          In my spare time I am web development hobbyist, spending my time
          learning web development technologies such as JavaScript, React and
          Vue.JS through the use of online resources and textbooks. This has
          enabled me to gain an in-depth understanding of how websites are
          structured, which is a great interest of mine. I am also able to be
          creative in building beautiful and responsive websites, and often
          learn more about website design with every project I undertake. Whilst
          most of my projects are predominantly front-end, I have also been
          learning back-end technologies such as Node.js.
